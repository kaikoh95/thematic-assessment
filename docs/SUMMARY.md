## Implementation Questions & Decisions

During implementation, several questions arose that required design decisions. These highlight areas where requirements could benefit from clarification:

### Data Validation & Quality

**Q: The provided example data files contain duplicate sentence IDs. Should these be accepted or rejected?**
- **Decision:** Reject with 400 validation error
- **Rationale:** Duplicate IDs would cause data integrity issues (multiple sentences with same ID in output). Strict validation ensures data quality.
- **Finding:** All 3 example files (`input_example.json`, `input_example_2.json`, `input_comparison_example.json`) contain 5+ duplicate IDs each and fail validation.

**Q: How should empty comparison arrays be handled (`"comparison": []` vs no field)?**
- **Decision:** Treat empty arrays as valid (no comparison mode)
- **Rationale:** Allows API flexibility - clients can include the field but leave it empty.

### Clustering Behavior

**Q: Should HDBSCAN noise points be kept as "unclustered" or reassigned to nearest cluster?**
- **Decision:** Reassign all noise points to nearest cluster
- **Rationale:** Users expect all input sentences to be categorized. Leaving sentences unclustered creates poor UX.
- **Implementation:** `assign_noise_to_nearest_cluster()` uses distance-based assignment after initial clustering.

**Q: What's the minimum acceptable cluster size?**
- **Decision:** `min_cluster_size=2` for HDBSCAN
- **Rationale:** Single-sentence "clusters" aren't meaningful themes. Minimum of 2 ensures actual grouping.

**Q: For comparison analysis, should baseline and comparison clusters be merged or kept separate?**
- **Decision:** Keep separate, label with `source` field
- **Rationale:** Users need to distinguish which dataset each cluster came from. Merging would lose this critical context.
- **Future:** Could add cross-dataset similarity analysis to identify shared themes.

### Insights & Output Format

**Q: How detailed should cluster insights be?**
- **Decision:** 2-3 key insights per cluster, focusing on actionable information
- **Rationale:** Balance between useful context and overwhelming users. Include percentage prevalence and sentiment extremes.

**Q: Should insights use markdown formatting (bold)?**
- **Decision:** Yes, using `**text**` for emphasis on key metrics
- **Rationale:** Matches example output format in requirements. Improves readability.

### Performance & Scalability

**Q: What response time is acceptable for various dataset sizes?**
- **Decision:** Target <3s for 100 sentences, <10s for 500 sentences (warm start)
- **Rationale:** Based on typical API timeout expectations. Lambda's 900s timeout (15 minutes) provides headroom.
- **Actual Performance:** ~990ms cold start, <3s warm for 100 sentences ✅

**Q: Should we implement concurrency limits to prevent cost overruns?**
- **Decision:** Not implemented (left to AWS account-level limits)
- **Consideration:** Production deployment should set reserved concurrency or use provisioned concurrency for cost control.

### Security & Authentication

**Q: Should API authentication (API keys, IAM, Cognito) be implemented?**
- **Decision:** Not implemented in MVP
- **Rationale:** Focus on core functionality first. Authentication can be added via API Gateway settings.
- **Future:** Recommend API key requirement for production (prevents abuse, enables rate limiting).

**Q: Should input size limits be enforced?**
- **Decision:** Rely on API Gateway 10MB payload limit
- **Consideration:** For production, recommend explicit validation (e.g., max 1000 sentences) to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Model Management

**Q: Should ML model versions be pinned or use latest?**
- **Decision:** Pinned versions in `requirements.txt`
- **Rationale:** Reproducibility and stability. Avoid breaking changes from upstream updates.
- **Versions:** `sentence-transformers==3.1.1`, `scikit-learn==1.5.2`, `hdbscan==0.8.38.post2`

**Q: How should model downloads be handled in Lambda environment?**
- **Decision:** Auto-download on cold start to `/tmp`, cache in ephemeral storage
- **Trade-off:** Slower cold starts (4-5s) vs simpler deployment. Alternative: Pre-bake models into Docker image (larger image) or use EFS (added complexity).

### Monitoring & Observability

**Q: What level of monitoring is expected?**
- **Decision:** CloudWatch Logs with structured logging (request ID, duration, cluster count)
- **Not Implemented:** Custom metrics, alarms, X-Ray tracing
- **Future:** Add CloudWatch custom metrics for cluster count, sentiment distribution, processing time percentiles.

**Q: How should errors be reported to users?**
- **Decision:** Structured error responses with `error` field, appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Include:** Request ID for tracking, but no internal stack traces (security)

## Architecture & Infrastructure

### Technology Stack

- **Runtime:** Python 3.12 on AWS Lambda (Docker container)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS CDK (Python) for Infrastructure as Code
- **Deployment:** Docker container images (10GB limit vs 250MB layer limit)
- **API:** Amazon API Gateway (REST API)
- **Region:** ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Docker Container over Lambda Layers**
   - ML dependencies (PyTorch, transformers, scikit-learn) exceed 250MB layer limit
   - Container images support up to 10GB, providing sufficient space for all dependencies
   - Platform set to `linux/amd64` for Lambda x86_64 compatibility

2. **Lazy Loading Pattern**
   - ML modules imported during invocation phase (900s timeout) instead of init phase (10s timeout)
   - Reduced cold start from 10s+ to ~990ms
   - Models cached globally across warm invocations for performance

3. **Ephemeral Storage Strategy**
   - All model caches (`/tmp`) use Lambda's ephemeral storage (2GB configured)
   - Environment variables redirect HuggingFace, Transformers, and Numba caches to `/tmp`

### Infrastructure Components

```
API Gateway → Lambda Function (Container) → CloudWatch Logs
                    ↓
            IAM Role (CloudWatch permissions)
```

**CDK Stack Outputs:**
- API Endpoint
- Lambda Function ARN/Name
- CloudWatch Log Group

## ML/AI Implementation

### Pipeline Architecture

```
Input → Validation → Embeddings → Clustering → Sentiment → Insights → Response
```

### Core Components

1. **Sentence Embeddings** (`clustering/embeddings.py`)
   - Model: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions)
   - CPU-optimized for Lambda environment
   - Batch processing for efficiency

2. **Clustering** (`clustering/clusterer.py`)
   - UMAP dimensionality reduction (384 → 5 dimensions)
   - HDBSCAN density-based clustering
   - Noise reassignment to nearest clusters
   - Dynamic cluster count (max 10)

3. **Sentiment Analysis** (`sentiment/analyzer.py`)
   - VADER sentiment analyzer (rule-based, no model loading)
   - Cluster-level and sentence-level analysis

4. **Insights Generation** (`clustering/insights.py`)
   - TF-IDF keyword extraction (max 10 keywords per cluster)
   - Statistical insights (distribution, sentiment patterns)
   - Percentage-based prevalence calculations

### Performance Characteristics

- **Cold Start:** ~4-5s (model download + initialization)
- **Warm Start:** <3s for 100 sentences, <10s for 500 sentences
- **Memory:** 3008 MB (3GB) optimal for ML workloads
- **Timeout:** 900s for large datasets (15 minutes)

## Known Limitations

1. **Cold Start Performance**
   - First invocation takes 4-5s to download models
   - Subsequent warm invocations are <3s

2. **Model Selection**
   - `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is lightweight but may not capture complex semantic relationships
   - VADER sentiment works well for general text but may struggle with domain-specific language

3. **Clustering Determinism**
   - HDBSCAN has some randomness in UMAP projections
   - May produce slightly different clusters on re-runs

4. **Scalability**
   - Single Lambda invocation limited to 900s timeout (15 minutes)
   - Very large datasets (>1000 sentences) may need chunking
